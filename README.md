# BABY-STORY
Kate Chopin wrote the short story, ''Désirée's Baby,'' in 1892, 27 years after slavery in America was abolished. This story is set during the time of slavery on a Louisiana plantation, exploring the role of racism in every facet of society.  This story is told by a third person narrator, a strategy which allows the reader to learn small but important pieces of information from the past. The protagonist, Désirée, was an abandoned child taken in by wealthy land-owners. The wealthy land-owners were Monsieur and Madame Valmondé, who raised Désirée as their own. At eighteen, Désirée marries Armand, the current owner of a nearby estate called L'Abri (French word for shelter), who falls deeply in love with her. Armand has a reputation for his strict personality and for mistreating his slaves.
